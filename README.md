# Books Data Engineering for AI Systems Capstone

## Overview
End-to-end data engineering pipeline built for the **Modern Data Engineering for AI Systems** Capstone.

This project processes book metadata through a complete modern data engineering pipeline. It starts with real-time ingestion using Apache Kafka, validates incoming records with Pydantic, stores the data in a Delta Lakehouse (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers), powers a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) search system, and orchestrates the entire workflow using Apache Airflow with automated data quality checks and lineage tracking.

**Dataset:** Books.csv

---

## Problem Statement

Book metadata collected from CSV files may contain missing values, invalid records, and inconsistent formats. This project builds a complete pipeline that validates, cleans, stores, and transforms the data into reliable datasets while enabling semantic search and ensuring every stage is monitored, traceable, and quality-controlled.

## Project Architecture

### 1. Ingestion
- Apache Kafka Producer
- Apache Kafka Consumer
- Pydantic schema validation
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for invalid records
- Validation error logging

### 2. Delta Lakehouse
- Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)
- Gold Layer (Business Aggregations)
- Delta MERGE (Upsert)
- Schema Enforcement

### 3. RAG Pipeline
- Document Chunking
- Embeddings Generation
- Vector Database
- Hybrid Search (Dense + BM25)
- Reranking
- Context-aware Question Answering

### 4. Orchestration
- Apache Airflow DAG
- Automated task dependencies
- Pipeline scheduling
- Failure handling

### 5. Quality Gate & Lineage
- Great Expectations
- OpenLineage
- Data validation reports
- Pipeline event tracking
